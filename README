QRQ - yet another CW trainer - Version 0.3.3

Project website: http://fkurz.net/ham/qrq.html
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

qrq is an open source Morse telegraphy trainer, similar to the classic DOS
version of Rufz by DL4MM, for Linux, Unix, OS X and Windows. 

It's not intended for learning telegraphy (have a look at radio.linux.org.au
for CW learning software or check out http://lcwo.net/), but to improve the
ability to copy callsigns at high speeds, as needed for example for Contesting.

How to use it

Using qrq is simple: qrq sends 50 random calls from a database. After each
call, it waits for the user to enter what he heard and compares the entered
callsign with the one sent. If the callsign is copied correctly, the speed is
increased by 10 CpM and full points are credited, if there were mistakes in the
callsign entered, the speed decreases by 10 CpM and (depending on how many
letters were correct) only a fraction of the maximum points are credited.

A callsign can be heard again once by pressing F6, hitting F10 quits the
attempt. The INS key toggles between insert and overwrite mode in the callsign
field. Pressing F5 leads to the settings screen. The _previous_ callsign
can be reheard by pressing F7.

The possible speed ranges from 20 CpM (4 WpM) to infinity, the initial speed
can be set by the user.

There is a simple toplist function in qrq which makes it possible for the user
to keep track of his training success or to compare scores with others.

You can submit your highscores via e-Mail to fabian@fkurz.net and they will
appear on the toplist published at https://fkurz.net/ham/qrqtop.html.
The toplist is not protected by any kind of checksum, it's based on honesty.

Additionally to the toplist, a detail summary file for each attempt is saved
in the "Summary" sub directory (on Windows: in the qrq directory; on Linux:
in ~/.qrq/), containing all sent and received callsigns, speeds and points.

The toplist file also includes a timestamp of the attempt, which makes it
possible to keep track of your training progress. Pressing F7 generates a
graph with score vs. date (GNUplot required, not on Windows). You may also
import the file into your favorite spreadsheet program to generate stats.

Options can be changed in the config file qrqrc or via the options menu (F5).
As of version 0.2.0, some additional training modes are available, which allow
e.g. unlimited usage of F6 (call repetition) and attempts that are longer than
the normal 50 calls.

A small Perl script, qrqscore, to synchronize the online-toplist
(http://fkurz.net/ham/qrqtop.php) with your local toplist is included as of
version 0.1.2.
